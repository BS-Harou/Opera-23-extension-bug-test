Opera-23-extension-bug-test
===========================

To test the regression, install this extension in Opera 21 and Opera 23 Dev. and then:

1. Open any regular page (e.g. http://opera.com ) in both O21 and O23.
2. There should be a **green** rectangle in left corner of the page.

In O21 this works fine, in O23 the rectangle is red because the style.css is not injected.



You can download and install this extension directly from:
